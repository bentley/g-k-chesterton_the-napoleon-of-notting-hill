				<i>TO HILAIRE BELLOC</i>
			</h2>
			<div class="ded">
				<p>
					<i>For every tiny town or place<br/> God made the stars especially;<br/> Babies look up with owlish face<br/> And see them tangled in a tree:<br/> You saw a moon from Sussex Downs,<br/> A Sussex moon, untravelled still,<br/> I saw a moon that was the town's,<br/> The largest lamp on Campden Hill.</i>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<i>Yea; Heaven is everywhere at home<br/> The big blue cap that always fits,<br/> And so it is (be calm; they come<br/> To goal at last, my wandering wits),<br/> So is it with the heroic thing;<br/> This shall not end for the world's end,<br/> And though the sullen engines swing,<br/> Be you not much afraid, my friend.</i>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<i>This did not end by Nelson's urn<br/> Where an immortal England sitsâ€”<br/> Nor where your tall young men in turn<br/> Drank death like wine at Austerlitz.<br/> And when the pedants bade us mark<br/> What cold mechanic happenings<br/> Must come; our souls said in the dark,<br/> "Belike; but there are likelier things."</i>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<i>Likelier across these flats afar<br/> These sulky levels smooth and free<br/> The drums shall crash a waltz of war<br/> And Death shall dance with Liberty;<br/> Likelier the barricades shall blare<br/> Slaughter below and smoke above,<br/> And death and hate and hell declare<br/> That men have found a thing to love.</i>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<i>Far from your sunny uplands set<br/> I saw the dream; the streets I trod<br/> The lit straight streets shot out and met<br/> The starry streets that point to God.<br/> This legend of an epic hour<br/> A child I dreamed, and dream it still,<br/> Under the great grey water-tower<br/> That strikes the stars on Campden Hill.</i>
